# Frontend Agent Mode, Airport Density Heatmap

**Goal**  
Build a Leaflet-based heatmap for airport density with hub markers, legend, and refresh button.

**Time** 12 to 18 minutes

## Step 1, Base map and heat layer
Copy into Agent Mode.
```
Create Earthport-Heatmap.html that loads Leaflet and Leaflet.heat. 
Show a full screen map and draw a heat layer from an embedded list of [lat, lon, weight].
```

## Step 2, Hub markers
Copy into Agent Mode.
```
For a small list of hubs, add circle markers with tooltips showing airport name and an estimated traffic score. Keep the heat layer.
```

## Step 3, Legend and refresh
Copy into Agent Mode.
```
Switch to a light basemap, add attribution, add a legend that explains intensity, and add a "Refresh Data" button that rebuilds layers from the dataset.
```
