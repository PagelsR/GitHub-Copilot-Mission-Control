# Frontend Demos

This folder contains demos that show how to apply GitHub Copilot to a React frontend that talks to the Wright Brothers API.

Demos are grouped by Copilot mode and purpose:
- **Chat**, rapid planning and code walkthroughs
- **Edits**, safe multi file changes
- **Integrations**, wiring APIs, state, tests, and accessibility
- **Agents**, coordinated end to end tasks
